        //   1. CopyFromCPU writes data1 to SharedBuffer.
        //   2. RunKernel queues dispatch D1 (returns immediately, async task in flight).
        //   3. CopyFromCPU writes data2 to SharedBuffer.
        //   4. RunKernel queues dispatch D2.
        //   5. D1 resumes after awaiting prior tasks. Its copy-IN reads SharedBuffer
        //      = data2 (already overwritten by step 3). D1 runs with WRONG data.
        //
        // The previous implementation eagerly snapshotted SharedBuffer at every queue
        // time, which closed the race but allocated MB-sized SABs for every dispatch
        // even when no race ever fires. Multi-pass kernels (RadixSort) that sort
        // in-place hit a separate failure mode: the cached snapshot pinned pre-pass-1
        // data; pass-2 read it via the cache and silently re-sorted the original input
        // (TJ regression report 2026-05-05). And ML pipelines with reused weight
        // buffers paid 5GB+ of wasted allocations across 100+ dispatches.
        //
        // The lazy approach below fixes both:
        //   - Each dispatch registers a queue-time HostWriteCounter intent.
        //   - The snapshot is allocated ONLY on the first NotifyHostWrite that fires
        //     while at least one intent is pending — i.e. only when the race actually
        //     occurs. For multi-pass GPU kernels with no host writes, no allocation.
        //     For ML weight reuse, no allocation.
        //   - At dispatch start, copy-IN uses the snapshot iff HostWriteCounter has
        //     advanced past the dispatch's queue-time value (host wrote during our
        //     wait). Otherwise it reads SharedBuffer directly — which by then carries
        //     all prior dispatches' copy-OUT data, exactly what multi-pass needs.
